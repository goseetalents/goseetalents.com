        <p>“In 2012, I got an opportunity to move to Sweden from Russia. By that day, I already had Sweden on my list of preferred countries.
            Particularly interesting was the growing startup scene, large number of engineering jobs, wide use of English, working
            culture emphasizing work-life balance but also permission for my wife accompanying me, which is not the case in some
            other countries.</p>
        <p>My first job in Sweden was at the Swedish FinTech unicorn Klarna. It was a great experience but after five years I wanted
            to find a way to try out different working environments and company sizes to better understand what works and what does
            not.</p>
        <p>Being a consultant at Go See Talents is a great way to do that without taking any risks that for example startups may involve.
            It also gives me the possibility to share my knowledge with young developers taking the first steps in their career.
            This resonated to my experiences of both seeing young developers struggling to get their first job, but also companies
            in urgent need for the right people yet having no resources to achieve this internally.</p>
        <p>Even though moving abroad with a family is not an easy task to accomplish, I am convinced that it was the the best choice.
            It has opened up many new possibilities. And to be honest, the common stereotypes portraying Swedes as reserved and unfriendly
            has proven to be completely wrong.”</p>
