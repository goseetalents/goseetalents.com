<p><strong>This Tech Talk will be completely dedicated to Behaviour Driven Development. We’ll give you a couple of real life examples of how we have used BDD. You’ll experience the difference of clarity and efficiency between the more traditional way of working with requirements/development/test and the BDD way.</strong></p><p>Probably there isn’t an experienced software professional out there who hasn’t experienced any of these situations:</p><p>- Analysis, development and test are working in silos (yes, this happens in teams who claim they are agile too)<br /> - Documents are passed back and forth between team members<br /> - There isn’t just one source of truth - there are several possible sources of truth and you don’t know which one to go for<br /> - The requirements are difficult to understand and there are ambiguities</p><p>BDD addresses all of that and brings some other aspects into it as well. Maybe you also heard of Specification by Example, Acceptance Test Driven Development or Test Driven Development? The similarities between those and BDD are many and we’ll briefly elaborate on that too.</p><p>This evening is about inspiring you to try out Behaviour Driven Development together with your team. We want to give you the arguments you need in order to get started. No one is an expert from the beginning and BDD is no exception. You’ll get basic knowledge, inspiration and tips on sources where you can find more information.</p><p>We’ll show real life examples of BDD in practise as well as give you a demo of the tool Cucumber.</p><p><strong> Agenda:</strong></p><p>17:00-17:30 Mingle and food<br /> 17:30-18:00 BDD - introduction and example<br /> 18:00-18:30 Demo of the tool Cucumber<br /> 18:30-19:15 BDD - example and how to get started<br /> 19:15 Mingle and continued discussions</p><p><strong>Target group:</strong></p><p>Any software professional who’s interested in improving the teamwork and way of working in their team. Any software professional who’s interested in trying something new to improve the quality of the software and to minimize the need for extra documentation.</p><p><strong>About the speakers:</strong></p><p>Anna Fallqvist Eriksson is a Software Professional. She’s very interested in learning and trying out efficient ways of working in the agile context.</p><p>Fredrik Rubensson is a Software Developer with a deep interest in quality. He started out with TDD back in the days when eXtreme Programming was the only agile methodology and has practiced it ever since.</p><p><strong>Sign up:</strong></p><p>Sign up on <a href="https://goseetechtalks-no3.eventbrite.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://goseetechtalks-no3.eventbrite.com.au</a>.
